# Spitfire

**Spitfire** is a HTML templating language created by YouTube. It was used primarily by the YouTube website from 2007 to 2017, after which it received reduced usage for the legacy frontend. Today, it is still used for the Polymer bootstrapper stub that every general web URL responds with, as well as the embedded player and subscription button pages, which are still based on the legacy [YouTube Frontend](#!/frontend/ytfe) core.

It is heavily inspired by the syntax of [Cheetah](https://cheetahtemplate.org/), another templating language for Python. This is claimed in the README\.md of the public GitHub page^[https://github.com/youtube/spitfire/blob/master/README.md], as well as implied in the earlier name of the project, Cheeter^[https://github.com/youtube/spitfire/blob/master/CHANGES#L377].

The original motivations for creating Spitfire were to optimize the performance of a Cheetah-like language using traditional compiler techniques.
