# YouTube Frontend (legacy)

The **YouTube Frontend** (YTFE), also known as Web Classic, was the legacy web frontend used by YouTube from 2006 until 2017. It has been replaced with the Polymer-based Web frontend used today. It was written in the Python programming language using the [Spitfire templating language](#!/backend/spitfire) for rendering HTML pages.

Although it was deprecated in 2017, it remained accessible until around 14 December 2020 for users who made an effort to continue using it. YTFE still receives minimal usage in some backroom pages of YouTube, including the embedded player and embedded subscription button pages.

Dating so far back, it was changed considerably throughout its lifetime.

## History

YouTube initially provided their service with only a PHP-based web frontend in 2005. PHP in YouTube was very short-lived. According to Erik Klein, a former YouTube employee from 2006 to 2009, the PHP frontend was already being done away with by the end of 2005 and was nearly completely replaced with Python by March of 2006, months prior to Google's acquisition.^[https://www.quora.com/Is-YouTube-still-written-in-PHP/answer/Erik-Klein] As such, it is likely that YouTube using Python was an independent decision, rather than one influenced by Google.

During 2006 and 2007, it is likely that YouTube used the [Cheetah templating language](http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/). This served as the direct inspiration for Spitfire, which YouTube has used primarily for templating since 2008.
